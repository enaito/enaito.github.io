	<h1>Biography</h1>
	<p>
		I am a senior from the Bay Area in California, studying Computer Science, Psychology, and Education. After graduation, I hope to pursue a career in education, starting with curriculum development or programming. I intend to return to school for my Masters and teaching certification before teaching elementary school, my lifelong dream.

	<p>
		In time not spent in classes, I can often be found fulfilling my duties as president of Tufts Hillel, TAing for COMP15, or helping with research projects at DevTech--teaching children as young as four years old how to code. In my remaining spare time, I enjoy spending time outside, knitting socks, reading Stephen King novels, and watching <span class="ital">Parks and Rec</span>.
